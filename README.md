# üöÄ Hello World ! I'm Snehasish Roy

Senior Software Engineer with a decade of turning coffee into code.

## üéØ What I'm Up To
Currently leading the Storage pod at [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/), where we're revolutionizing fintech in India. Previously commanded the Core Platform pod, because one technical challenge is never enough!

## ‚ö° Projects That Keep Me Awake

### Clockwork: Distributed Job Scheduler at PhonePe
Built a Distributed, Durable, and Fault-Tolerant Task Scheduler that orchestrates 2 billion daily jobs at PhonePe. Shared about it at our [tech blog](https://tech.phonepe.com/clockwork-the-backbone-of-phonepes-2-billion-daily-jobs).

### Docstore: Document Store at PhonePe
Designed an Object Store managing ~5B documents. You can find our war stories at [FOSDEM 2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sds_lessons_learnt_glusterfs/).

## Personal Tech Blog
I write about system design and distributed systems on my blog. If you're interested in scaling systems or handling distributed consensus, check out my articles at [snehasishroy.com](https://snehasishroy.com)

## üíº Previous Chronicles

### Google (SWE3)
Led the Map Moderation Platform team, where I built a MapReduce Pipeline for analyzing UGC moderation decisions. Think of it as keeping Google Maps clean and tidy!

### Amazon (SDE2)
Made shopping carts zoom faster (50ms @ p90) on the Tier1 Cart Team. Because every millisecond counts when you're panic-buying during sales!

### Goldman Sachs (Technology Associate)
Turbocharged Risk Infrastructure platforms by using In-Memory Relational Database. Turns out making financial systems faster is both challenging and rewarding (pun intended).

### Morgan Stanley (Technology Associate)
Optimized Risk Infrastructure platforms by using an async framework, because making numbers go fast is fun when they represent billions of dollars! üìà

## Education
Graduated from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad with B.Tech in IT (_Honours_) 

## ü§ù Ping Me!
Always excited to discuss:
- Distributed systems (and their distributed problems)
- Scale challenges (both technical and coffee-based)
- Why documentation is like vegetables - everyone knows it's good for you, but...
